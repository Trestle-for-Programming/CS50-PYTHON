# Academic Honesty

This course’s philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as **“be reasonable.”** The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course’s material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. The course’s policy characterizes both sides of that line.  

- Watch [this video]() for context  
- Or read [this paper]() for context  

## Policy  
The essence of all work that you submit to this course **must be your own**. Unless otherwise specified, collaboration on assessments (e.g., assignments, labs, problem sets, projects, quizzes, or tests) is **not permitted** except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you. Generally speaking, when asking for help:  
- You may show your work to others,  
- But you may not view theirs,  
provided you and they respect this policy’s other constraints.  

### Regret Clause  
If you commit some act that is not reasonable but bring it to the attention of the course’s heads by emailing `certificates@cs50.harvard.edu` **within 72 hours**, the course may impose local sanctions (e.g., unsatisfactory/failing grade for submitted work). The course will **not** refer the matter for further disciplinary action except in cases of repeated acts.  

## Rules of Thumb  
Below are non-exhaustive guidelines. If uncertain whether an act is reasonable:  
1. **Do not commit it** until you receive written approval from the course’s heads.  
2. Acts deemed **not reasonable** are handled harshly.  
3. For punitive disciplinary outcomes, the course reserves the right to impose additional local sanctions (e.g., failing grade for work/course) and may recommend exclusion (required withdrawal).  

### Reasonable  
- Communicating with classmates about assessments in English (or spoken language), **with proper citation**.  
- Discussing course material to improve understanding.  
- Helping a classmate identify a bug in their code **after submitting your own work** (via viewing/compiling/running their code).  
- Incorporating **a few lines** of non-solution code from external sources **with citation**.  
- Showing your code to someone for debugging help.  
- Submitting the same/similar work to this course that you previously submitted to *this course*.  
- Using external resources (web, etc.) for instruction/references/technical help—**but not for outright solutions**.  
- Using CS50’s AI tools (e.g., `cs50.ai`) to ask questions—**but not presenting its answers as your own**.  
- Whiteboarding solutions using diagrams/pseudocode (**not actual code**).  
- Working with/paying a tutor who **does not do your work for you**.  

### Not Reasonable  
- Accessing a solution to an assessment before (re-)submitting your own.  
- Accessing/attempting to access another’s account without permission.  
- Viewing a classmate’s solution before (re-)submitting your own.  
- Failing to disclose score-affecting bugs in course software.  
- Decompiling/deobfuscating/disassembling staff solutions.  
- Failing to cite external code/techniques integrated into your work.  
- Showing/giving your solution to a struggling classmate.  
- Artificially manipulating scores (e.g., exploiting software bugs).  
- Paying/offering to pay for work you submit as your own.  
- Sharing solutions with past/present/future students.  
- Searching/soliciting outright solutions online or elsewhere.  
- Splitting an assessment’s workload and combining work.  
- Submitting modified work of another beyond "a few lines."  
- Submitting the same/similar work to *another course* (unless explicitly allowed).  
- Using third-party AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot) that suggest answers/code.  
- Viewing another’s solution and basing your own on it.
