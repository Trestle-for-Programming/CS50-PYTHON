# Software and Hardware

## My codespace is behaving strangely. What should I do?
The first step is always to attempt to restart your Codespace container. Issues can appear for various reasons, but a restart (by visiting `cs50.dev/restart`) usually resolves the problem. **Be patient** as rebuilding/restarting may take several minutes.  

If unresolved:  
âž” Refer to our [technical documentation for Visual Studio Code for CS50](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/vscode/).

## Why does it seem like course content or third-party services are blocked?
Your access issues may stem from:  
1. **Your device/network**:  
   - Blocked by security tools (virus scanners, firewalls)  
   - Test with another device on a different network  
2. **Network restrictions**:  
   - Contact your network administrator  
   - Try an alternative network connection  
3. **Government regulations**:  
   - Local trade/content laws may restrict access  

**Next step**: Reach out to our [communities for help](https://cs50.harvard.edu/community).

## Can you help me circumvent content blocking?
**No.**

## Can I change my GitHub or edX username while taking the course?
**No.** Changing either username will result in **permanent loss of course progress**.  
- If already changed: Immediately revert to your original username  
- We cannot recover lost progress
