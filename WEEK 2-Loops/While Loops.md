# While Loops

The `while` loop is a fundamental control structure found in nearly all programming languages. It repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition remains true.

## Key Characteristics
- Repeats code until its condition becomes false
- Requires careful setup to avoid infinite loops
- Universally implemented across programming languages

## Example: Infinite Loop (Bug)
```python
i = 3
while i != 0:
    print("meow")
