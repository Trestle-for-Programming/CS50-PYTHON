# Loops

Essentially, loops are a way to do something over and over again.  

1. **Start by creating `cat.py`**:  
   Type `cat.py` in the terminal window to create the file.

2. **Initial code without loops**:  
   In the text editor, begin with this code that repeats the same `print()` statement:  
   ```python
   print("meow")
   print("meow")
   print("meow")
- Running this code by typing python cat.py, you’ll notice that the program meows three times.
- In developing as a programmer, you want to consider how one could improve areas of one’s code where one types the same thing over and over again. Imagine where one might want to “meow” 500 times. Would it be logical to type that same expression of print("meow") over and over again?
- Loops enable you to create a block of code that executes over and over again.
