## üìã Problem Sets & Projects

### 1. **Problem Sets**
- **Cash**: Implement a greedy algorithm to calculate the minimum coins needed for change.
- **DNA**: Analyze DNA sequences to identify matches with a CSV database.
- **Mario**: Print pyramids using loops (inspired by Super Mario Bros).
- **Sentimental**: Refactor earlier C-based problem sets into Python.

### 2. **Projects**
- **Final Project**: A capstone project combining Python with libraries like Flask, SQL, or Pandas.
- **Examples**:
  - A web app using Flask/Django.
  - Data analysis with Pandas/NumPy.
  - Automation scripts (e.g., file renaming, web scraping).
